# DodgeCorona
A simple and fun to play COVID-19 pandemic themed Android game as a means to spread some much-needed awareness regarding social distancing norms and use of personal protective equipment (PPE).

The main character is trying to get home and dodges obstacles which are infected people. If the player enters the 6 feet radius (shown by green circle) of any infected person (enemy) the player gets infected and game over.

The player movement is completely controlled using the gravity accelerometer.

The player can pick a Power Up which is a medical mask for protection against infection for 5 seconds. During this time even if the player goes close to an enemy, he won‚Äôt get infected.

The difficulty of the game increases with time as the obstacle speed increases with time.
